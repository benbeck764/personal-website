# Getting Started with Next.js

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on building modern web applications with Next.js! This series will take you through everything you need to know to get started.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications. It provides features like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on the server for better performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **App Router**: Modern routing with layouts and nested routes
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints directly in your Next.js app

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js simplifies many aspects of React development:

```typescript
// Simple Next.js page component
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## What You'll Learn

In this series, we'll cover:

1. **Installation and Setup** - Get your development environment ready
2. **Configuration** - Customize Next.js to fit your needs
3. **Building Your First App** - Create a real-world application

> This is a beginner-friendly series, but some knowledge of React is helpful.
