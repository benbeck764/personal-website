# Installation and Setup

Let's get your Next.js development environment up and running!

## Creating a New Project

The easiest way to start is with `create-next-app`:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies.

## Project Structure

After creation, you'll see this structure:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   └── ...
├── public/
├── package.json
└── next.config.ts
```

## Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your app!

## Key Files

- **`app/layout.tsx`**: Root layout component
- **`app/page.tsx`**: Home page
- **`next.config.ts`**: Next.js configuration

That's it! You're ready to start building.
