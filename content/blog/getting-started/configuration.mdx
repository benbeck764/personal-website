# Configuration and Customization

Now that we have Next.js installed, let's customize it for your needs.

## Next.js Configuration

The `next.config.ts` file controls Next.js behavior:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  // Add your custom config here
};

export default nextConfig;
```

## TypeScript Configuration

Next.js includes TypeScript support out of the box. The `tsconfig.json` file is automatically generated.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for local development:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Access it in your code:

```typescript
const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
```

## Styling Options

Next.js supports multiple styling approaches:

- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS files
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **CSS-in-JS**: Libraries like styled-components

## Next Steps

You're now ready to build your first real application! Continue to the next section to start building.
