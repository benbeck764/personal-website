# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! This is a test post to showcase the blog system.

## About This Blog

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js 16**: The latest version with App Router
- **MDX**: Markdown with JSX support
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **TypeScript**: For type safety

## Features

Here's what this blog system supports:

### Code Syntax Highlighting

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

### TypeScript Support

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Ben",
  email: "ben@example.com",
};
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important information or quotes.

## What's Next?

I'll be writing more posts about:

- Web development
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- React and Next.js
- Software engineering practices

Stay tuned for more content!
